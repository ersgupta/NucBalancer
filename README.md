# GENSET

GENSET is a versatile tool designed to assist in optimizing nucleotide pooling strategies for high-throughput genomic analyses. The tool evaluates nucleotide distribution uniformity across positions and allows users to set customizable red flag thresholds, ensuring optimal results while accommodating variability.

## Features

- Evaluate and optimize nucleotide distribution in pooling configurations.
- Define red flag thresholds for the entire set and individual positions.
- Flexible parameter customization to match specific experimental needs.
- Identify potential bias-inducing deviations from desired nucleotide percentages.

## Getting Started
